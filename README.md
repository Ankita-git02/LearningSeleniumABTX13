Got it 👍 — you want a `README.md` file that clearly says this repo is for your **learning journey of Selenium 4 concepts** from the notes, not a polished framework repo yet.
Here’s a clean and simple version you can directly use as your README:

# Selenium 4 Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to my **step-by-step learning journey** of **Selenium 4.x Web Automation**.
I will practice every concept from *TheTestingAcademy – Selenium 4.x Notes (Pramod)* and organize my code examples here.

## 📚 What I Am Learning

I will be covering the following concepts:

* ✅ **Setup & Basics**

    * Java, Maven, IntelliJ/Eclipse, WebDriver Manager, Selenium Manager
    * First Selenium script

* ✅ **WebDriver & Navigation**

    * Open browser, URLs, navigation commands
    * Quit vs Close, Sessions

* ✅ **Locators & Elements**

    * ID, Name, ClassName, TagName
    * CSS Selectors & XPath (axes, functions)
    * Tools like SelectorsHub

* ✅ **Waits in Selenium**

    * Implicit Wait
    * Explicit Wait (ExpectedConditions)
    * Fluent Wait
    * Best practices (don’t mix waits)

* ✅ **Interactions**

    * Input boxes, buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, alerts
    * Tables (static/dynamic)
    * Actions API (hover, drag-and-drop, keys)

* ✅ **Windows & Frames**

    * Handling multiple windows/tabs
    * IFrames, nested frames
    * Switching back

* ✅ **Advanced DOM Handling**

    * Shadow DOM
    * SVG Elements
    * JavaScript Executor

* ✅ **Test Frameworks & Utilities**

    * TestNG
    * Page Object Model (POM) & PageFactory
    * Apache POI (Excel) for Data-Driven Testing
    * Log4j Logging
    * Allure Reporting

* ✅ **Scalability**

    * Selenium Grid 4
    * Docker setup for parallel execution
    * Cloud Testing (BrowserStack, etc.)

* ✅ **CI/CD Basics**

    * Running tests on Jenkins

## 🎯 My Goal

* Learn Selenium 4 **from basics to advanced**.
* Write **small practice scripts** for every concept.
* Gradually build a **mini automation framework** as I progress.

## 🛠️ How To Run (later when I add code)

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
mvn clean test
```
